refactor(account): Use UserProfileSerializer for /me endpoint

- Modified the "me" endpoint in UserViewSet to correctly use the UserProfileSerializer with the user's profile object
- Added request context to the serializer for proper URL resolution of image fields
- Updated the update logic to use serializer.save() to invoke the custom update method in UserProfileSerializer
- Improves handling of both User and Profile data in a single endpoint
